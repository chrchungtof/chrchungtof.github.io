							<h2>Abstract</h2>


							<p>

							Human-computation games (HCGs) enables players to
perform real-world tasks as a by-product of playing them.
Since these tasks typically require domain knowledge, game
designers map them onto simpler ones that non-experts can
tackle. In many HCGs, most details on how the game
mechanics abstract the task are left undisclosed, leaving
players oblivious to how they are truly contributing. One
outstanding question is whether revealing such details can
promote player motivation. This paper presents a study
carried out on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers
using the MATCHMAKERS HCG. The study examined the
impact of context disclosure at four levels of granularity:
from zero context, the task’s significance, the description of
the task, to how the task is accomplished through game
mechanics. Based on the study’s findings, AMT Workers
were most motivated when receiving the task’s description.
This work aims to provide insights into how context can be
used to better motivate HCG players.</p>
