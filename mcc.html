							<h2>Abstract</h2>

							<p>

							From phone calls to instant messaging, a myriad of channels exist for users to connect with others. While it is nice to have an array of options to choose from, maintaining several channels of communication can be overwhelming and hamper one’s ability to manage them. This implores the question of how users cope with the vast number of ways to connect with others. To better understand the challenges associated with multiple communication channel use, this paper presents an investigation of how college graduates keep in touch after a relocation, and proposes design considerations to better facilitate the management of one’s communications.</p>
