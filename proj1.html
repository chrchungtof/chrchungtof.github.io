							<h1>Goodbye Repetitive Tasks, You Won't Be Miseed</h1>

							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>The advent of the graphical user interface (GUI) has provided users with an easy and intuitive way to operate a computer. Although it alleviates many of the struggles faced by laypersons when adopting new technologies, the GUI suffers from an inherent lack of programmability and the ability to specify abstract commands. Oftentimes, users must manually carry out repetitive tasks, such as the transferring of multiple files from one application into another. This work provides an overview of the literature that has insofar attempted to support repetitive GUI tasks, the problems that still need to be addressed, and possible directions for future work.</p>
